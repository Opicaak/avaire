## Want to use AvaIre but don't want to host it yourself?

No problem, we maintain a public instance of AvaIre that you can invite to your server!<br>Visit https://avairebot.com/invite to get started!

## Want more control and run AvaIre yourself?

The advantages of selfhosting AvaIre are numerous. A few core freedoms that are added can be for instance the ability to tweak commands and add custom commands, changing the bot's workings et cetera.

There are currently not many resources for users wishing to run AvaIre on their own, but guides and documentation are continuously being worked on and added to the [documentation](https://avairebot.com/docs), you can check there for any setup or configuration guides.

If you are not into hosting the bot yourself, you can always invite AvaIre to your server [from here](https://avairebot.com/invite).
